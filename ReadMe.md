<h2>About this project:</h2>

This webscraper is my project for the [Data Engineering with Python Course at Platzi](https://platzi.com/clases/ingenieria-datos/) 

As well, this is one of the challenges for Platzi Master -- an education acceleration program to form the future tech leaders in LATAM.

<h2>Brief description:</h2>

The objective of this course was to program a web scraper that could access to El Universal and El Pais newspapers in order to extract links, titles and body text. 
With this web scraper, we produce a csv that can be later used for data manipulation and analysis.
